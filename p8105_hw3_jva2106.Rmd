Loading the tidyverse dataset and formatting the data to use appropriate variable names with a focus on the “Overall Health” topic and including only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” while organizing responses as a factor taking levels from “Excellent” to “Poor”:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(p8105.datasets)

data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_smart_df = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  select(-(class:question), -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>% 
  mutate(response = forcats::fct_relevel(response, c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) 
 
```
